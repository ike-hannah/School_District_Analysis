# School District Analysis
In this project I analyzed data from an entire school district. The information most pertinent to this analysis was the percentage from each school of students passing reading and math. Before I began a lot of cleaning work had to take place to be able to use the pandas libray from python to really drill down into the data. Once cleaning had been done and initial analysis completed, my team and I noticed that some values from a specific school might be evidence of academic dishonesty. I replaced these values with null values and re-completed my inital analysis. 
# Results
The removal of values from the data set changed my inital analysis
* Values in the district summary went down by a few points Before:![Screen Shot 2022-01-16 at 9 09 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65744738/149689953-7cf01a5c-74e8-43bd-aadd-8e7c74ad7a05.png)

* The overall school summary was relatively unaffected except for the values in Thomas High School
* Becuase of the removal of the ninth grade at thomas high, the overall padding percentages all dipped slightly

* The scores by school spending, size, and type were all relatively unaffected as such as small number of students were removed
# Summary
In summary by replacing the ninth grade values though to be incorrect the updated verion of the district analysis showed math and reading scores down
and specifically scores at Thomas went down in reading and math as well.

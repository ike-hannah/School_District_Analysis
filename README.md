# School District Analysis
In this project I analyzed data from an entire school district. The information most pertinent to this analysis was the percentage from each school of students passing reading and math. Before I began a lot of cleaning work had to take place to be able to use the pandas libray from python to really drill down into the data. Once cleaning had been done and initial analysis completed, my team and I noticed that some values from a specific school might be evidence of academic dishonesty. I replaced these values with null values and re-completed my inital analysis. 
# Results
The removal of values from the data set changed my inital analysis
* Values in the district summary went down by a few points Before:![Screen Shot 2022-01-16 at 9 09 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65744738/149689953-7cf01a5c-74e8-43bd-aadd-8e7c74ad7a05.png)

* The overall school summary was relatively unaffected except for the values in Thomas High School
* Values for Thomas High School drastically improved after the removal of the fraudulent values Before:![Screen Shot 2022-01-16 at 9 16 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65744738/149690631-ea1e286f-0219-41ae-a42b-8ef31b72312f.png)

* As you can see the math anf reading scores both increase dramatically when only counting the tenth thorugh twelfth grades at Thomas High
* The scores by spending size and type were all relatively unaffected as the number of students removed from the overall evaluation was very small

# School_District_Analysis
In this project I analyzed data from an entire school district. The information most pertinent to this analysis was the percentage from each school of students passing reading and math. Before I began a lot of cleaning work had to take place to be able to use the pandas libray from python to really drill down into the data. Once cleaning had been done and initial analysis completed, my team and I noticed that some values from a specific school might be evidence of academic dishonesty. I replaced these values with null values and re-completed my inital analysis. 
# Results
The removal of values from the data set changed my inital analysis
* Values in the district summary went down by a few points ![Screen Shot 2022-01-16 at 9 09 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65744738/149689953-7cf01a5c-74e8-43bd-aadd-8e7c74ad7a05.png)
